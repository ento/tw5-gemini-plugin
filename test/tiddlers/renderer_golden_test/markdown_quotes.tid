> How to compose a successful critical commentary:
> 1: You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, "Thanks, I wish Iâ€™d thought of putting it that way."
> 2: You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
> 3: You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
> 4: Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.
